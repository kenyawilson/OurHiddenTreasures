    <p class="about-info">Our focus is to unlock our hidden treasures one mind at a time.  We will accomplish this by
      promoting self-love and
      teaching vital life skills.  Skills such as Financial Literacy, Healthy Living, and the importance of providing
      free-will humanitarian services in our community.  These attributes and many more will shift our conscious mind to
      not only excel in our day to day humanitarian endeavors but also, lead and transfer (these) qualities in our
      personal and surrounding connections.</p>

        <div class="vertical-text">
          <p>April’s commitment to others stems from her personal relationships. Some of her most precious titles
            include
            friend, daughter, sister and aunt. As an adolescent, April watched her father and mother serve in a Pastoral
            role in the church. They were and continue to be a model for seeing the best in others and providing an
            outlet
            of added support to those in need. As the oldest of 5 brothers, nurturing and showing love to her siblings,
            nieces and nephews has been a great joy. She always makes time for them and that general willingness to help
            others birthed the vision for Our Hidden Treasures.</p>
          <p>What started as trips to the skating rink or manicure
            pampering sessions for those who may be less fortunate, has turned into an opportunity to encourage and help
            people realize their own potential. April’s most prized hidden treasures include compassion, strong work
            ethic
            and a servant’s heart. As the Executive Director of Our Hidden Treasures, April is dedicated to inspiring
            the
            society of Upstate South Carolina to become treasured assets in their community because everyone is called
            to
            empower someone </p>
