      promoting self-love and
      teaching vital life skills.  Skills such as Financial Literacy, Health & Wellness, and the importance of providing
      free-will humanitarian services in our community.  These attributes and many more will shift our conscious mind to
      not only excel in our day to day humanitarian endeavors but also, lead and transfer (these) qualities in our
      personal and surrounding connections.</p>

          <div class="vertical-text">
            <p>April’s commitment to others stems from her personal relationships. Some of her most precious titles
              include
              friend, daughter, sister and aunt. As an adolescent, April watched her father and mother serve in a
              Pastoral
              role in the church. They were and continue to be a model for seeing the best in others and providing an
              outlet
              of added support to those in need. As the oldest of 5 brothers, nurturing and showing love to her
              siblings,
              nieces and nephews has been a great joy. She always makes time for them and that general willingness to
              help
              others birthed the vision for Our Hidden Treasures.</p>
            <p>What started as trips to the skating rink or manicure
              pampering sessions for those who may be less fortunate, has turned into an opportunity to encourage and
              help
              people realize their own potential. April’s most prized hidden treasures include compassion, strong work
              ethic
              and a servant’s heart. As the Executive Director of Our Hidden Treasures, Inc, April is dedicated to
              inspiring
              the
              society of Upstate South Carolina to become treasured assets in their community because everyone is called
              to
              empower someone </p>
