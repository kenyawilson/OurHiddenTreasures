        other organizations or individuals.<br><br>
        We respect your confidentiality.<br><br>
        Online donations and event registrations are transmitted via a secure server using encryption technology. Some
        online forms on our website are created with third party software through non-proprietary contracts we hold. We
        only use trusted registration software provider(s) that also utilize encryption technology.<br><br>
        On occasion, we may allow access to your information to specific funding sources, only as mandated by
        contractual requirements. We are diligent in our efforts to ensure that your information is never compromised in
        any way.<br><br>

        our reply and your email address as part of our ongoing service and follow-up efforts. We reserve the right to
        contact you after you have contacted us and may send future communications to you about our organization. Please
        notify us via email if you wish to discontinue electronic communication. This includes opt-outs for our
        newsletter and donation messages.<br><br>
        Upon written request, we will gladly remove your personal information from our databases, except where
        legislation or regulation requires that we retain it (for example, charitable giving history tied to income tax
        receipts.)<br><br>
